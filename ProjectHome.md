# Nibiru Framework #

Nibiru is a Java server-side development framework created at Oxen.

The framework objective is to facilitate the building of modular applications. The following goals are established in order to meet such objective:
  * Providing an abstraction layer over different technologies in order to avoid coupling.
  * Providing services which are common to business applications, such as CRUDs, reports, workflow, transaction management, security and internationalization.
  * Providing dynamic update mechanisms for the system in order to allow hot swapping.
  * Implementing patterns which facilitate solving problems in a structured way. But avoiding to force the user to implement a given solution.
  * Facilitate decoupled communication among modules.
  * Avoiding reinventing the wheel. Creating layers of abstraction but using existing technologies when possible.

The implementations are based on many technologies, such as OSGi, Vaadin, Spring and Hibernate.

Look at the [Getting Started](GettingStarted.md) section, wich is extracted from reference documentation. Also check the [brainstorming](brainstorming.md) section for ideas about the future of the framework.

Is Nibiru for you? Look at the [motivation](motivation.md) section in order to see why we are using it. Believe it or not, there are [people using](WhoIsUsingThis.md) this framework!

The API is still unstable. Wer'e working on many improvements, as you can see on the [releases page](Releases.md).
